# CoderDojo Bishops Cleeve Website

This is the source for the website of the Bishops Cleeve CoderDojo, a coding club for kids.  The site is currently hosted at https://bc-coderdojo.netlify.app

The website is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).  

If you are familiar with JavaScript and React (or you'd like to learn!), this repo could easily be forked to create a site for your own Dojo.


## Developing

Run the site locally with the standard gatsby command:

```shell
cd my-default-starter/
gatsby develop
```

## Updating the Main Page

The main page content is split across a number of components.  In the future it would be good to move this data into config or to files in the `src` folder.

## Updating the Blog

Blog posts can be found under `src/blog/`

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
