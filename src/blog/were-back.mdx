CoderDojo is returning to Bishops Cleeve Library!

The free coding club for kids ages 7-17 is back.  We will be learning the basics of coding with Scratch, as well as helping the more advanced kids move on to making websites/apps or even robotics.

Our first session will be on Saturday 10th Sept, 1-3pm.  Book your space now:

We can't wait to see you there and get started on some awesome projects!
